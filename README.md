## Testing
Currently there's a lack of testing. If you want to help with adding tests you can do that by creating tests inside the tests directory. Currently tests are written with the package [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html). For more documentation regarding [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) see their [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).
